# NetworkingPlayground

## Overview
After a long time of procrastinating and studying other things, I am fuinally going to dive into networking programming. 

## Goals
Im doing this project in hopes to:
- gain knowledge about networking programming
- Make a chat system
- implement a networking system into a game engine I'll make one day, make a mulitplayer engine <-- The dream goal

## My Personal Engines:
### [**DayDreamEngine**](https://github.com/mray2014/DayDreamEngine)
- My latest engine I created to learn and study how to make an engine multi-threaded
- Combining all my years of experience with building engines to structure the engines architecure correctly
- Making the engine multiple platform so that adding new platforms like (DirectX/OpenGL/Vulkan) to the lower levels run smoothly

### [**Cosmic Engine**](https://github.com/mray2014/CosmicEngine)
- My third custom game engine I made that I believe is the best structured engine I've created so far
- Whats interesting about this project is that around this time I started learning about hardware and optimizations
- This engine put to test some architectures I thought of so structure the engine where most of the data was cache friendly optimized efficiently


### [**GenesisX**](https://github.com/mray2014/GenesisX)
- My second game engine I have created and it is honestly the one engine I most proud of
- After researching for weeks I finally implemented Deferred rendering into the engine, the hard work paid off
- Once I got that feature in I started steam rolling new graphical features in easily like HDR and Bloom because of all the knowledge I gained from Deferred Rendering


### [**Enginerino**](https://github.com/mray2014/Enginerino)
- My first game engine I ever created that I hold near and dear to my heart, even though it's not very good haha
- Implemented instance rendering for primitive models
- Created Tetris inside with my engine that plays smoothly
- This is when I found out engines were awesome and that I was about to down a very very VERY deep rabbit hole
